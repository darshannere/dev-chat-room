## UI Components

This project uses **ShadCN UI components** for building a modern, minimalist interface:

- **Card**: For user input and messaging sections.
- **Avatar**: Displays user initials or profile image.
- **Input**: Used for username input and message input.
- **Button**: Send button for sending messages.
- **Label**: For labeling input fields.
- **Icons**: Using the `lucide-react` icon library for the "Send" button icon.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm run start`: Runs the built app in production mode.

## WebSocket Connection

The chat application connects to a WebSocket server hosted on Render. On joining the chat, the user sends their username to the server, and messages are exchanged in real-time. The list of connected users is also updated dynamically.

**WebSocket URLs**:

- **Backend**: `https://backend-web-chat-app.onrender.com/`

## Tailwind CSS

This project uses **Tailwind CSS** for rapid UI development. The class names are utilized for styling components like the message bubble, button, and form elements.

## Example Usage

1. Open the application and enter your username to join the chat.
2. Once connected, send messages to the chat and see others' messages in real-time.
3. View the list of online users on the right panel.
